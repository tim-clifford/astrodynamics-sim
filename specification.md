# Astrophysics Simulation

## Engine:

- Able to model Keplerian orbits
- Able to simulate Newtonian motion in n body systems
- Able to render 3D space into 2D
- Able to simulate light intensity and reflections in systems with multiple luminous bodies.
- Simple collision modelling (join into more massive body?)

## Interface:

- Add bodies with Keplerian or Newtonian descriptions
- Pause, modify variables, and continue.
- Able to place camera at any point
- Zoom, pan, rotation etc.
- Place several cameras and switch between them
- Save/Load system (using serialization)

## Stretch Goals:

- Variable Acceleration Spacecraft
- Realistic collision modelling
- Visualisation of Hill Spheres
- Radiation Pressure
- Atmosphere
- Belt/ring modelling as a fluid (I.e Saturnâ€™s rings, Asteroid belt)
- Relativity
