Below are descriptions of the various orbital elements you can change

Name | Description | Symbol | Range
---|---|---|---
Semi-latus rectum | the distance between two bodies at right angles to the “periapsis” (minimum point) | ρ | [0,+∞)
Eccentricity | A measure of the shape of the orbit, illustrated below | e | [0,+∞)
Inclination | the angle between the orbital plane and the reference plane | i | \[0,180\]
Longitude of the ascending node | the angle from the reference direction anticlockwise to the point where the orbiting body rises above the reference plane | Ω | [0,360)
Argument of periapsis | the angle from the ascending node anticlockwise to the periapsis. | ω | [0,360)
True anomaly | the angle from the periapsis anticlockwise to the current position of the body. | ν | [0,360)

The best way to understand how these work is to modify the variables of an existing system.

In Simulation Controls:

Control     | Effect
------------|------------
Esc         | Pause and edit variables
L           | camera lock
R           | Reset camera
F           | Change camera focus
Mouse       | Move Camera
Scroll      | Zoom
Up/Down     | Increase/Decrease size of planets (realistic sizes cannot be seen)
Right/Left  | Increase/Decrease running speed (it is more accurate at lower speeds)
PgUp/PgDown | Increase/Decrease trail length
