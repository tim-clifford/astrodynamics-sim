# Algorithms:

GetAcceleration(PlanetarySystem): 
	returns a list of the instantaneous acceleration of each body, using Newton's laws
	1. generate zero array of length number of bodies
	2. recurse through all pairs of bodies, finding force*G, GM*Gm/r^2 
	3. add acceleration , F/GM (GM is stored in the body) to each relevant element

TimeStep(PlanetarySystem, acceleration, step): 
	applies the acceleration to the planetary system and calculates velocity and position,
	assuming constant acceleration, for the given step (in s).
	1. Iterate through bodies and acceleration
	2. Add acceleration*step to velocity
	3. Add 1/2 * a * t^2 to position
ReflectionPlanes(luminous body,PlanetarySystem):
	returns the plane axis of reflection of each body in the PlanetarySystem from the luminous body.
	This refers to the hemisphere that light reaches.
VisiblePlanes(position vector of observer, PlanetarySystem):
	returns the plane axis through each body to which the 
	vector between the observer and the centre is normal.
Color(PlanetarySystem):
	Finds the average color of each body
Draw(reflection planes, visible planes, colors):
	converts the results of the last three algorithms into a 2D array to be drawn to the screen


Draw(point):
	simulates light rays from each source, accounting for decreasing intensity
	and reflections, and returns a bitmap of the result at the given point.
Display(bitmap):
	Handles display output, including GUI

click handling, need to research
