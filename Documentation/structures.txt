Vector3:
    - three dimensional vector class
    - supports implicit:
        vector-vector additon/subtraction
        scalar-vector multiplication/division
        equality operations
        negation
    - supports dot and cross products, logarithms, magnitude
    - used for storing position, velocity, rgb color, etc
Matrix3:
    - 3x3 square matrix
    - supports implicit:
        matrix-matrix additon/subtraction
